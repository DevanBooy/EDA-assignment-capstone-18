Summary of the Data Set

The data set was obtained by the UCI Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing. 

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. 

The bank-additional-full.csv contains all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analysed in [Moro et al., 2014]. This dataset is publicly available for research. The details are described in [Moro et al., 2014].

Number of Instances: 41188 for bank-additional-full.csv
Number of Attributes: 20 + output attribute.

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).
